# Car-dodge-game
A retro-style car racing game for the Windows console, written in pure C++ — no fancy graphics libraries, just good ol’ gotoxy() and grit 😎. Dodge enemies, earn points, and beat your high score. Perfect for nostalgia or just flexing your console skills.
✨ Features

🎮 Keyboard Controls

A to move left

D to move right

Esc to rage quit

🚘 Simple ASCII Car Design – Drawn with love and plus signs.

💥 Collision Detection – Crash = game over. It hurts emotionally too.

🔊 Sound Effects – You get beeps. Lots of 'em.

📂 Automatic High Score Saving

highscore.txt tracks your all-time greatness

Score updates now happen right at game over (no more missing records!)

📈 Real-time Scoreboard – Updates on the side while you drive like a maniac.

⟳ Replay Loop – Menu shows up after each game so you can try again and again… and again.

👀 Smooth UI Using gotoxy() – Clean AF console layout.

🧱 Double Enemy System – More cars. More stress. You're welcome.

🛠 Requirements

✅ Windows OS

✅ C++ Compiler (g++, MSVC, etc.)

✅ A console that isn't allergic to windows.h

📂 File Breakdown

main.cpp – Literally the entire game.

highscore.txt – Auto-created to store your epic wins (or sad losses).

🚗 Use of the Project: Car Dodging Game (Console Version)
🎯 Objective:
To create a simple console-based arcade-style game that helps beginners understand the fundamentals of game development using C++.

💡 What this project teaches:
Basic Game Logic: Game loops, collision detection, score handling.

Console UI Manipulation: Using cursor positioning (gotoxy), screen clearing, and ASCII rendering.

Real-time Input Handling: With kbhit() and getch() for responsive controls.

Sound Effects Integration: Via Beep() for feedback, adding life to the game.

Structuring Larger Programs: Splitting into functions and managing flow.

🧑‍💻 Ideal For:
Programming students learning C++

Game dev hobbyists exploring logic behind movement, collisions, etc.

Quick demos for workshops, internships, or class projects

🚀 Future Aspects & Enhancements
🕹 Gameplay Enhancements
Levels/Difficulty: Speed up enemies or add more lanes as the score increases.

Multiple Cars/Obstacles: Introduce variety in enemy designs and behavior.

Power-ups: Temporary invincibility, score multipliers, or slow-mo.

🎨 Graphics & UI
Upgrade from console to a graphical version using SFML, SDL, or OpenGL.

Add background visuals, animations, and improved car/enemy sprites.

🔊 Audio
Replace Beep() with actual background music and sound effects using audio libraries like FMOD or irrKlang.

🌐 Multiplayer / Online Features
Local multiplayer (WASD + Arrow keys)

Online leaderboard for scores

Save progress and high scores

📱 Platform Expansion
Port to mobile or browser-based version using frameworks like:

C++ + Qt for mobile

HTML5 + JS + WebAssembly for web

📈 In Summary:
This project is a launchpad—simple but powerful. With a lil more logic and a lot of imagination, it could evolve into a full-blown arcade game 💪
